          <header>A basic Dart program</header>
          <p>
            The following code uses many of Dart’s most basic features:
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>
              // Define a function. <br />
              printInteger(int aNumber) {<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;print('The number is $aNumber.'); // Print to
              console.<br />
              }<br />
              <br />
              // This is where the app starts executing. <br />
              main() { <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;var number = 42; // Declare and initialize a
              variable.<br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;printInteger(number); // Call a function.<br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Here’s what this program uses that applies to all (or almost all)
            Dart apps:
          </p>
          <p>
            // This is a comment. <br />
            A single-line comment. Dart also supports multi-line and document
            comments. For details, see Comments.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Important_concepts">
          <header>Important concepts</header>
          <p>
            As you learn about the Dart language, keep these facts and concepts
            in mind:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Everything you can place in a variable is an object, and every
              object is an instance of a class. Even numbers, functions, and
              null are objects. All objects inherit from the Object class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Although Dart is strongly typed, type annotations are optional
              because Dart can infer types. In the code above, number is
              inferred to be of type int. When you want to explicitly say that
              no type is expected, use the special type dynamic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Dart supports top-level functions (such as main()), as well as
              functions tied to a class or object (static and instance methods,
              respectively). You can also create functions within functions
              (nested or local functions).
            </li>
            <li>
              Similarly, Dart supports top-level variables, as well as variables
              tied to a class or object (static and instance variables).
              Instance variables are sometimes known as fields or properties.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identifiers can start with a letter or underscore (_), followed by
              any combination of those characters plus digits.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>Variables</header>
          <p>
            Here’s an example of creating a variable and initializing it:
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>var name = 'Bob'; </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Variables store references. The variable called name contains a
            reference to a String object with a value of “Bob”.
          </p>
          <p>
            The type of the name variable is inferred to be String, but you can
            change that type by specifying it. If an object isn’t restricted to
            a single type, specify the Object or dynamic type, following design
            guidelines.
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>dynamic name = 'Bob'; </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Another option is to explicitly declare the type that would be
            inferred:
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>String name = 'Bob'; </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> This page follows the style guide
            recommendation of using var, rather than type annotations, for local
            variables.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Built-in_types">
          <header>Built-in types</header>
          <p>The Dart language has special support for the following types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>numbers</li>
            <li>strings</li>
            <li>booleans</li>
            <li>lists (also known as arrays)</li>
            <li>sets</li>
            <li>maps</li>
            <li>runes (for expressing Unicode characters in a string)</li>
            <li>symbols</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can initialize an object of any of these special types using a
            literal. For example, 'this is a string' is a string literal, and
            true is a boolean literal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because every variable in Dart refers to an object—an instance of a
            class—you can usually use constructors to initialize variables. Some
            of the built-in types have their own constructors. For example, you
            can use the Map() constructor to create a map.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
          <header>Functions</header>
          <p>
            Dart is a true object-oriented language, so even functions are
            objects and have a type, Function. This means that functions can be
            assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions. You
            can also call an instance of a Dart class as if it were a function.
            For details, see Callable classes.
          </p>
          <p>Here’s an example of implementing a function:</p>
          <div>
            <code>
              bool isNoble(int atomicNumber) { <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp; return _nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null;<br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            Although Effective Dart recommends type annotations for public APIs,
            the function still works if you omit the types:
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>
              isNoble(atomicNumber) { <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp; return _nobleGases[atomicNumber] != null; <br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            For functions that contain just one expression, you can use a
            shorthand syntax:
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>
              bool isNoble(int atomicNumber) => _nobleGases[atomicNumber] !=
              null;
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            The => expr syntax is a shorthand for { return expr; }. The =>
            notation is sometimes referred to as arrow syntax.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Control_flow_statements">
          <header>Control flow statements</header>
          <p>
            You can control the flow of your Dart code using any of the
            following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>if and else</li>
            <li>for loops</li>
            <li>while and do-while loops</li>
            <li>break and continue</li>
            <li>switch and case</li>
            <li>assert</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            You can also affect the control flow using try-catch and throw, as
            explained in Exceptions.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Exceptions">
          <header>Exceptions</header>
          <p>
            Your Dart code can throw and catch exceptions. Exceptions are errors
            indicating that something unexpected happened. If the exception
            isn’t caught, the isolate that raised the exception is suspended,
            and typically the isolate and its program are terminated.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast to Java, all of Dart’s exceptions are unchecked
            exceptions. Methods do not declare which exceptions they might
            throw, and you are not required to catch any exceptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dart provides Exception and Error types, as well as numerous
            predefined subtypes. You can, of course, define your own exceptions.
            However, Dart programs can throw any non-null object—not just
            Exception and Error objects—as an exception.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Classes">
          <header>Classes</header>
          <p>
            Dart is an object-oriented language with classes and mixin-based
            inheritance. Every object is an instance of a class, and all classes
            descend from Object. Mixin-based inheritance means that although
            every class (except for Object) has exactly one superclass, a class
            body can be reused in multiple class hierarchies.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Generics">
          <header>Generics</header>
          <p>
            reason for using generics is to reduce code duplication. Generics
            let you share a single interface and implementation between many
            types, while still taking advantage of static analysis. For example,
            say you create an interface for caching an object:
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>
              abstract class ObjectCache { <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;Object getByKey(String key); <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;void setByKey(String key, Object value); <br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            You discover that you want a string-specific version of this
            interface, so you create another interface.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Libraries_and_visibility">
          <header>Libraries and visibility</header>
          <p>
            The import and library directives can help you create a modular and
            shareable code base. Libraries not only provide APIs, but are a unit
            of privacy: identifiers that start with an underscore (_) are
            visible only inside the library. Every Dart app is a library, even
            if it doesn’t use a library directive.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Asynchrony_support">
          <header>Asynchrony support</header>
          <p>
            Dart libraries are full of functions that return Future or Stream
            objects. These functions are asynchronous: they return after setting
            up a possibly time-consuming operation (such as I/O), without
            waiting for that operation to complete. The async and await keywords
            support asynchronous programming, letting you write asynchronous
            code that looks similar to synchronous code.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Generators">
          <header>Generators</header>
          <p>
            When you need to lazily produce a sequence of values, consider using
            a generator function. Dart has built-in support for two kinds of
            generator functions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Synchronous generator: Returns an Iterable object.</li>
            <li>Asynchronous generator: Returns a Stream object.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            To implement a synchronous generator function, mark the function
            body as sync*, and use yield statements to deliver values:
          </p>
          <div>
            <code>
              Iterable&lt;int&gt; naturalsTo(int n) sync* { <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;int k = 0; <br />
              &nbsp;&nbsp;while (k < n) yield k++; <br />
              }
            </code>
          </div>
          <p>
            To implement an asynchronous generator function, mark the function
            body as async*, and use yield statements to deliver values.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most computers, even on mobile platforms, have multi-core CPUs. To
            take advantage of all those cores, developers traditionally use
            shared-memory threads running concurrently. However, shared-state
            concurrency is error prone and can lead to complicated code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of threads, all Dart code runs inside of isolates. Each
            isolate has its own memory heap, ensuring that no isolate’s state is
            accessible from any other isolate.
          </p>

            documentation comments.

          <p>
            A single-line comment begins with //. Everything between // and the
